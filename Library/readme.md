# Library Project

- This project is from the The Odin Project curriculum 
- it's semi-responsive

### What dawned into me/I learnt

1. naming conventions is *really* important
2. it dawned into me that it's okay to declare numerous variables
3. in order to have functionality in click events, pass in a function, then define the function
4. javascript is really an event-based language
5. most of the script are copied but I understood what they do, in the near future, i can be proud on my future projects are all written(done) by me.
